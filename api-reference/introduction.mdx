## Welcome

Welcome to the Chopcast API Documentation. Chopcast API allows you to create short clips from long videos, making it ideal for use cases such as podcasts and TV shows for social media.

## Authentication

Chopcast API requires two levels of authentication: **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and **API Key**.

### JWT Authentication

JWT is used for user login and obtaining an API key. To authenticate, send a POST request to `/auth/jwt/create/` with your email and password. Upon successful login, you will receive a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the response, which you should include in the `Authorization` header of your subsequent requests using the format `JWT <token>`.

### API Key Authentication

Once you have obtained a JWT, you can create an API Key by sending a POST request to `/key/create/`. Provide the API key's name in the request body. The API Key serves as your authentication method for all other endpoints. Include it in the `Authorization` header with the format `Api-Key <key>`.
